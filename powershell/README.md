PowerShell Profile
==========

Requires module [`posh-git`](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git) to be installed. Borrowed the 'cddash' function from [here](http://windows-powershell-scripts.blogspot.kr/2009/07/cd-change-to-previous-working-directory.html).

Use `Install-Module posh-git` to install it if you have [PsGet](http://psget.net/).
