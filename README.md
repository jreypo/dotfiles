My dotfiles
===========

My dotfiles for Linux, Windows and OSX. Includes PowerShell, Bash, tmux and VIM environment files.

Credit goes mostly to [Timo Sugliani](https://twitter.com/tsugliani) and [Fabio Raposselli](https://twitter.com/fabiorapposelli) from whom I borrowed some examples and files.

iTerm color schemes are mine and one taken from Adam Hawkins [dotfiles](https://github.com/ahawkins/dotfiles).

## Installation

To install in OSX clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/jreypo/dotfiles.git` and execute `osx_setup.sh` script in folder `osx`.

## TODO
- Enhance Linuxtdorfiles
- Script to automate the installation in Linux
