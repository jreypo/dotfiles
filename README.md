My dotfiles
===========

My dotfiles for Linux. Includes Bash and VIM environment files. 

Credit goes mostly to [Timo Sugliani](https://twitter.com/tsugliani) and [Fabio Raposselli](https://twitter.com/fabiorapposelli) from whom I borrowed some examples and files. 

**TODO**
- OSX version
- Bash-it files
- Script to automate the installation
