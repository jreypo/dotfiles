My dotfiles
===========

My dotfiles for Linux, Windows and OSX. Includes PowerShell, Bash, tmux and VIM environment files.

Credit goes mostly to [Timo Sugliani](https://twitter.com/tsugliani) and [Fabio Raposselli](https://twitter.com/fabiorapposelli) from whom I borrowed some examples and files.

iTerm color schemes are mine and one taken from Adam Hawkins [dotfiles](https://github.com/ahawkins/dotfiles).

## Installation

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/jreypo/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`.
2. For OSX execute `osx_setup.sh` script in folder `setup`.
3. For Fedora 23 Workstation execute `fedora_setup.sh` script in folder `setup`.

## TODO
- Enhance Linux dotfiles
- Add `irssi` config files
