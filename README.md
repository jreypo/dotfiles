My dotfiles
===========

My dotfiles for Linux, Windows and OSX. Includes PowerShell, Bash, tmux and VIM environment files.

Credit goes mostly to [Timo Sugliani](https://twitter.com/tsugliani) and [Fabio Raposselli](https://twitter.com/fabiorapposelli) from whom I borrowed some examples and files.

iTerm color schemes are mine and one taken from Adam Hawkins [dotfiles](https://github.com/ahawkins/dotfiles).

**TODO**
- Enhance OSX files
- Bash-it files
- Script to automate the installation
